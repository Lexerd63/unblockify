Unblockify







A simple web proxy that uses replit to browse the internet freely


How to set-up:


If you want to rehost this proxy you will have to clone this github repo


Go on replit and chose to run with github


Host it then get the live replit link


go into the section in index.html "const proxyServer = "https://your-replit-username.repl.co"



replace https://your-replit-username.repl.co with your live site name



Your backend has succesively been up if you see ✅ Unblockify proxy running on port ${PORT}`



Host your frontend with some static web hosting like netifly



Your proxy is succesfully up!
